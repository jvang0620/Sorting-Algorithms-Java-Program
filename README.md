<!-- About the Program -->

# Sorting Algorithms Java Program

- This program is a modular Java application that allows the user to input an array of integers and choose from various sorting algorithms to sort the array.

- Here's a breakdown of the program's functionality:

<!-- The Main Class -->

## Main Class (Main method in the MainProgram Class):

- Takes user input for the size and elements of an array.
- Asks the user to choose a sorting algorithm.
- Invokes the chosen sorting algorithm to sort the array.
- Displays the original and sorted arrays.
- Sorting Algorithm Interface (SortingAlgorithmInterface):
- Displays the original and sorted arrays.
- This structure makes it easy to add or modify sorting algorithms. The user can choose a sorting algorithm at runtime, and the program will apply the selected algorithm to sort the array.

<!-- All the sorting classes -->

#### Sorting Algorithm Classes:

##### BubbleSort:

- Implements the bubble sort algorithm.

##### MergeSort:

- Implements the merge sort algorithm.

##### QuickSort:

- Implements the quick sort algorithm.

##### SelectionSort:

- Implements the selection sort algorithm.

##### InsertionSort:

- Implements the insertion sort algorithm.

##### HeapSort:

- Implements the heap sort algorithm.

##### ShellSort:

- Implements the shell sort algorithm.

<!-- How to get started -->

## Getting Started

To run Sorting Alogorithms Java Program on your local machine, please follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine one of the following:
   HTTPS: <pre><code>git clone https://github.com/jvang0620/Sorting-Algorithms-Java-Program.git</code></pre>
   SSH: <pre><code>git clone git@github.com:jvang0620/Sorting-Algorithms-Java-Program.git</code></pre>

2. In the terminal, type `javac MainProgram.java` then click 'enter' to compile your Java source code into bytecode so that it can be executed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

3. In the terminmal, type `java MainProgram` then press 'enter' to executes the bytecode generated by the compiler using the JVM.

4. The program will display in the output. Happy Coding! :)
