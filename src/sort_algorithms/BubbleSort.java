/**
 * Implementation of the Bubble Sort algorithm.
 * Bubble Sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm that repeatedly
 * steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they
 * are in the wrong order. This process is repeated for each element in the list
 * until the entire list is sorted.
 *
 * Time Complexity:
 * - Best Case: O(n) (when the array is already sorted)
 * - Average Case: O(n^2)
 * - Worst Case: O(n^2)
 * Space Complexity: O(1) - Constant space complexity.
