/**
 * Implementation of the Selection Sort algorithm.
 * Selection Sort works by dividing the array into two parts:
 * 1. Sorted part at the beginning.
 * 2. Unsorted part at the end.
 * In each iteration, it finds the minimum element in the unsorted part
 * and swaps it with the first element of the unsorted part, effectively
 * extending the sorted part.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(n^2) - Quadratic time complexity.
 * Space Complexity: O(1) - Constant space complexity as it only requires
 * a constant amount of additional memory.
