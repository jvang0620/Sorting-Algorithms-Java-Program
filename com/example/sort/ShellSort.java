/**
 * Implementation of the Shell Sort algorithm.
 * Shell Sort is an in-place comparison-based sorting algorithm that uses a
 * sequence of increment values (gaps) to sort elements that are far apart,
 * gradually reducing the gap between elements until the entire array is sorted.
 *
 * Time Complexity:
 * - Best Case: O(n log n) (depends on the chosen gap sequence)
 * - Average Case: O(n^1.5) (depends on the chosen gap sequence)
 * - Worst Case: O(n^2) (depends on the chosen gap sequence)
 * Space Complexity: O(1) - Constant space complexity.
