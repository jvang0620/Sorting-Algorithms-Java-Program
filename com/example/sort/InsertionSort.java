/**
 * Implementation of the Insertion Sort algorithm.
 * Insertion Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted
 * array
 * one element at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than more
 * advanced
 * algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort.
 *
 * Time Complexity:
 * - Best Case: O(n) - When the array is already sorted.
 * - Average Case: O(n^2) - When elements are in random order.
 * - Worst Case: O(n^2) - When elements are in reverse order.
 * Space Complexity: O(1) - Constant space complexity.
 *
 * @param array The array to be sorted.
